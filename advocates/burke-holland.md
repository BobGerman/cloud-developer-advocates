## Bio 🔥

Burke is a web developer living in Nashville, TN; the greatest city in the world. He likes JavaScript a lot because it's the only way he Node to Express himself. Get it? Is this thing on? 🎤

Nevermind.

Look, Burke blogs only slightly better than he codes and definitely not as good as he talks about himself in the third person. The legal requirement for living in Nashville is to play a 🎸, so Burke plays the bass and tries in vain to rekindle his dreams of rock stardom. He's also a huge fun of running, lengthy bios and sarcasm.

Burke works on the Azure team on behalf of JavaScript developers everywhere. You can find him on various social media networks and writing all the best words at <a href="https://www.burkeknowswords.com">burkeknowswords.com</a>
