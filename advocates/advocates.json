      "Biography": "I've been at Microsoft for 5.5 years, and a contractor for another 6 years prior. In my last role, I worked on docs.microsoft.com, writing C++ and gamedev docs. Before that, I worked on the TED team in DX, helping game developer partners port their titles to Windows and Windows Phone. Our team shipped titles like Candy Crush, as well as popular indie games like Prune and Monument Valley. Prior to that, I started at Microsoft working on [Coding4Fun](http://channel9.msdn.com/coding4fun/) under Channel 9. From that role, I'm probably most known for my [.NET Wiimote library](http://github.com/BrianPeek/WiimoteLib), but I have also written a [pile of articles and projects](https://brianpeek.com/projects/), worked a bit on the Kinect for Windows SDK, the Microsoft Mustang ([Project Detroit](http://channel9.msdn.com/coding4fun/articles/Project-Detroit-An-Overview)), [BoxingBots](http://channel9.msdn.com/coding4fun/projects/BoxingBots), and the [LEGO EV3 Sentry Bot](http://channel9.msdn.com/Blogs/BUILD-Conference-Highlights/Lego). I have also co-authored two now-outdated books: \"[Coding4Fun: 10 .NET Programming Projects for Wiimote, YouTube, World of Warcraft, and More](http://www.amazon.com/Coding4fun-Programming-Projects-Wiimote-Warcraft/dp/B005SN8BCS/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1326495821&sr=8-1)\" and \"[Debugging ASP.NET](http://www.amazon.com/Debugging-ASP-NET-Jonathan-Goodyear/dp/0735711410/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1326495859&sr=8-1)\". Prior to all that, I worked in several small (and one large) consulting companies you’ve never heard of.  \n\nWhen I'm not working, I'm probably restoring the pinballs in my garage, playing a game, or working on yet another gamedev or emulation project I'll probably never finish (an Atari Lynx game presently). I have several closets filled with gaming memorabilia, original console dev kits, and a variety of other rare and unique gaming items. \n\nFind me at [https://twitter.com/BrianPeek](https://twitter.com/BrianPeek) and [https://brianpeek.com/](https://brianpeek.com/)\n",

      "Biography": "I've been in the tech industry for almost 20 years, though not always in the most traditional ways. \nAt 13 I built my own using spare parts my dad had laying around and I've been a hardware nerd ever since. I have spent my time teaching photoshop workshops, doing business mentoring, building websites, and auditing social media and SEO. I did that for about 10 years, but in 2011, I decided to take this front-end dev thing full time. I took up consulting and got to work with some really cool start-ups and some not so cool enterprises, but in doing so I found myself working with OpenStack. The OpenStack community was rad, and I wanted to contribute so I started with DOCS and after doing that for a while I decided I wanted to do more, so I joined Hackbright as an Engineering Fellow and learned Python. I graduated and was immediately hired by Rackspace. Since then, I've become a huge contributor in the Linux and Go communities and have finally found my happy place as a developer advocate. \nIn my spare time, I'm a mentor at WeWork, General Assembly, AngelHack, and CapitalFactory and I'm on the board of multiple engineering groups including Redis Austin, Big Data Analytics Club, and Austin All Girl Hack Night. My passion is helping more underrepresented individuals join and feel comfortable in tech and I'm often a resource for new developers trying to find their way.\nhttps://twitter.com/ashleymcnamara",

      "Biography": "My career began in 1997 with stints at several internships and startups. My first languages were JavaScript (who would've thought it'd still be a thing today?) and Perl (regex FTW!). In 2002, the dot-com bubble burst and I ended up as a .NET dev at a large enterprise. I was there for over 10 years until I finally got tired of being a real-life Dilbert and started to follow my passions again. Most recently, I was a software architect at an e-commerce startup in Vancouver, BC. In addition to our technical accomplishments, I am proud of the teams we built and the collaborative and DevOps culture that we created.\n\nA few years ago, I discovered and fell in love with Azure. I started blogging, presenting and hosting meetups and events about the platform. I also enjoy interacting with the product teams to make Azure better. I eventually became an Azure MVP, and now has led me to join APEX as a Cloud Developer Advocate. I feel extremely fortunate to be able to do what I love as my full-time 'job' and to have an opportunity to make Azure awesome while working alongside an amazing group of people.\n\nThese days, I split my time building applications in .NET and Node. The Azure technologies that I'm super excited about include: Azure Functions, ACS/Kubernetes, and VSTS.\n\nWhen I'm not in front of a keyboard, I enjoy living in Vancouver and hanging out with my wife and 2 children. I also play hockey, but I am really bad at it; I'm surprised they haven't kicked me out of Canada for that.\n\nhttps://twitter.com/nthonyChu",

It was a Compaq Presario that ran Windows 95 with 56k modem that woke up the house whenever you tried to get on the internet. This is the machine that I created my first \"web page\" on; my name in bold letters on a white background. As trivial as it sounds, at that moment I knew what I wanted to have a career in computing.\n\nOriginally from St. John's, Antigua, I'm a teacher, podcaster and software developer residing in South Florida with many years of experience building applications on the .NET Framework. Currently I specialize in building solutions utilizing C#, ASP.NET, JavaScript and Azure. I have a passion for software architecture, testing, and web technologies. I also co-host the 'Away from The Keyboard Podcast'. Throughout my career I've been able to continue that cycle of learning, experimenting and teaching. I think those habits are what lead me to start speaking at Code Camps and eventually teaching at Miami Dade College.

      "Biography": "My curiosity of computers began in my early childhood years playing on a family member's Macintosh SE. I was too young to understand the world of programming then, but it was enough to peak my interest. In my teen years the internet became very popular and I was infatuated with the concept of building my own websites, and like all teenage computer geeks the thrill of \"learning to hack\". I cut my teeth building my own websites and learned to program by modifying open-source forum software in Perl and PHP, and running my own Counter-Strike servers. Before I knew it I was being offered money to program as a profession. I've been in the open-source and Linux world ever since.\n\nI spent a lot of my early career as a Web Developer at Disney working on their e-commerce platforms in Java and their own internal language and spent the rest of my career moving further and further down the stack as my interests in deeply technical topics, systems programming and distributed computing became a passion. After that, I did a several year stint working for startups building high-scale distributed systems for things like fraud detection, mostly in Ruby and the Go programming language.\n\nThe past couple years I've been at Comcast working on Kubernetes, Docker and distributed systems designing and building their linear video streaming platform that provides cable video for millions across the country. It really resonated with my love for high-scale distributed systems and unique challenging problems.\n\nOutside of engineering roles, I've been very passionate about helping educate and build communities around the Go programming language, Kubernetes and Docker. I've contributed to all of these projects, co-authored a book on Go, co-host a podcast about Go and co-organize GopherCon, an annual conference for the Go programming language that attracts 1,500 developers each year.\n\nIn my downtime I'm very interested in information security, and teaching myself linux internals, assembly, embedded programming and electronics and have a couple hobby projects like a bbq grill controller I try to sneak time into as I can.

      "Biography": "I've always had a passion for computers. I was left home alone when my parents had to work when I was seven, and because we didn't own any games for our TI-99/4A I did what I imagine any other kid would have done: I cracked open the manual and keyed in a BASIC program that made a little icon dance. From that point I was hooked, moving from that to machine language on a Commodore 64 and on to languages like Fortran, COBOL, Pascal, RPG/ILE, C, C++, and the rest was history. For the past 20 years I've been building enterprise applications, the first half of my career on the product side (for example, I was the third employee at AirWatch back when it was called Wandering WiFi because we started out as a hotspot provider before doing mobile device management) and the last half as a consultant working for Wintellect and more recently iVision. I've managed teams my entire career and one of my first published articles was in a magazine called News/400 about managing teams in 1998.\n\nMy family has a passion for the outdoors. I do a lot of hiking and have done some section hikes on the Appalachian trail with my daughter. As a family, we summited our first \"14er\" last summer (Mt. Sherman in Colorado) and then my daughter and I hiked a half marathon up Pike's Peak. We are a vegan family although sometimes we might let eggs slide when it's too tough to put something decent together. We've been on a 99.99% plant-based diet for three years now. I've always loved the game of pool and shoot a competitive nine-ball and one pocket game. I do CrossFit on a regular basis and love to read fantasy and science fiction.

      "Biography": "I come to Microsoft after a long career in the industry as a software developer. Initially an electrical engineer, I started coding professionally for Siemens in the 90s (in C!) and did a postgrade education in software engineering. Back then all the cool kids did Java and so I did too. Those were fun days but then I discovered .NET in 2001 and never looked back. I did it all, from WinForms to WebForms to ASP.NET. But I was always interested in design and so when Siemens sent me to Vegas at the first MIX conference and I discovered XAML and Blend, I was sold. The next years were spent doing a lot of WPF, Silverlight (Loved it!) and all subsequent XAML-based technologies. I wrote Silverlight 2 Unleashed for Sams in 2008 and later Silverlight 4 Unleashed. In 2009 I also published an Model-View-Viewmodel framework called MVVM Light Toolkit which has become surprisingly popular, and led me to speak about this architecture pattern and the XAML (and later Xamarin) technologies all around the world. I spoke at MIX three times (2009, 2010, 2011) which is one of the most amazing experiences of my professional life.  Even though I was more of a client guy, I am really excited about Azure. Next to being a Windows Dev MVP from 2007 to 2017, I was also a Microsoft Regional Director since 2013 ( [http://rd.microsoft.com](http://rd.microsoft.com)) and I saw how excited this amazing group of people is about Azure. It is clear for me that this is the place to be. That's why I got really excited when I received the offer to join this team and work with a lot of friends and colleagues on promoting and teaching it. On the private side, I love to garden (I have a fish pond with water lilies, toads, newts, and many fishes of many kinds), go hiking in the Swiss mountains that I call home, travel all around the world and explore. I recently acquired a DJI Mavic Pro quadcopter which led me to [start making videos](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCb_gm1NXTZXyvqgXAh_H32A/videos) as well [as pictures](https://www.instagram.com/lbugnion/) of the amazing places I am lucky to visit. I love to spend time with my family (I have two teenage daughters, who can be both adorable and exhausting) and friends. A big part of my professional activity is speaking at conferences worldwide, and I love to travel and meet, train, teach people everywhere I can.

Back then it was a magazine, now it's Stack Overflow. Who's with me? I have spent my career building and selling software companies ranging in size from five employees to 300+ employees. My Microsoft tech career started with an Access Database connected to a classic ASP website. Then .NET was released, and everything has been getting better day-by-day. From .NET 1.0, 1.1, 2.0….. every 3-6-12 months life added new and better ways of developing. Remember before nuget? That wasn't very long ago!\n\nAlong the way, I have always been a fan of teaching. With a motto of \"Learn. Build. Share.\" I started and nurtured several long term local communities in Arizona. I love screen casting, and sharing \"HOW DO I\" videos about software. Mainly I focused on Visual Studio Tips/Tricks, but I'm excited to expand these efforts. I also love presenting on stage, the bigger the stage the happier I am. In my spare time, I love the ocean. Beaches, boating, diving, snorkeling, all of it. Family time is best spent learning new languages (I'm currently failing Spanish) and being in the sand and the water with my family! \n\n[https://twitter.com/scottcate](https://twitter.com/scottcate)",

But I tell you I can read code like no one's business and I got to the point where I could see what was coming next and so on. \n\nWell, he decided to upgrade to the fancy Commodore 128 and I got the 64 to dink around with, well since I had so much experience reading the code to him, I decided I would give it a hack and wrote my first text based role playing game at 11. It was fun for me to play and so started the journey. \n\nI didn't touch a PC again until after college when AOL came out, then \"view source\" was discovered and I learned HTML that way. I've started User Groups for Windows Phone, worked in Government Software, Public Records Systems, created major reservations systems for Cruise Companies and worked for a mouse. \n\nI love to teach regardless of the student, and I'm not afraid to be the student. In my off time, I enjoy any time with my wife and kids or training for my next triathlon.    \n\n[https://twitter.com/spboyer](https://twitter.com/spboyer)",
