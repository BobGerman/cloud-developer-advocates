  ## Bio
  I lead developer advocacy for Azure. I joined Microsoft when we acquired Wunderlist, for which I was CTO. I've spent years in the open source world, creating open source software, organizing and speaking at conferences (founded and co-organized RubyConf and RailsConf for a decade) and writing books. 

  I spend a lot of my free time in the startup and venture capital communities as an advisor, investor, and curious observer.
